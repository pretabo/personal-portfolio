        <div class="shell">
          <h2>How I Work</h2>
          <p>I focus on understanding the real problem before deciding what to build. Friction usually shows up in workflows, unclear ownership, or systems behaving in ways people don't expect.</p>
          <p>I keep the longer-term direction in view, making deliberate trade-offs so short-term delivery reduces complexity rather than adding to it.</p>

          <h3>Discover</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Understand the real problem</p>
          <p>I start by understanding the real problem, not just the symptoms. By speaking directly with users and bringing colleagues into those conversations, I surface hidden friction in workflows and ensure we focus on pragmatic solutions that create real value.</p>
          <p>At The Economist, this meant working closely with editorial teams to observe publishing workflows and uncover friction ahead of CMS migration planning.</p>

          <h3>Define</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Turn complexity into clarity</p>
          <p>I translate complexity into clear outcomes so teams know exactly what they are building and why it matters. Engineers are never left in doubt about expectations, and stakeholders can see how the work connects to measurable impact.</p>
          <p>During platform migration work, I converted competing stakeholder needs into clear delivery goals and success criteria that engineers could execute with confidence.</p>

          <h3>Align</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Create shared direction</p>
          <p>I bring engineers, stakeholders, and partners together to build shared understanding and strong working relationships. Clear alignment builds trust, keeps initiatives value-driven, and creates momentum across teams.</p>
          <p>Delivering changes to high-visibility publishing systems required aligning editorial leadership, engineers, and product stakeholders around shared priorities and trade-offs.</p>

          <h3>Build</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Deliver value pragmatically</p>
          <p>I work closely with engineers to deliver incrementally, balancing new capabilities with the realities of supporting complex systems. This approach creates space for teams to ship meaningful improvements while maintaining reliability and technical health.</p>
          <p>I supported delivery of features such as text-to-speech and enhanced podcast controls while ensuring stability for daily newsroom operations.</p>

          <h3>Improve</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Reduce friction continuously</p>
          <p>I treat delivery as the start of improvement, using feedback and operational insight to simplify workflows and remove friction. Attention to detail and a methodical approach help ensure each iteration makes the product easier to use and more effective.</p>
          <p>Refining content tools based on newsroom feedback helped streamline editorial workflows and reduce manual work.</p>

          <h3>Learn</h3>
          <p class="how-i-work__subtitle">Use evidence to adapt</p>
          <p>I use real usage, feedback, and team insight to guide what comes next. By sharing learnings and recognising team successes, I help build a culture that improves continuously and strengthens both the product and the people building it.</p>
          <p>Post-launch reviews and usage insights informed future priorities and helped teams improve both the platform and the way we worked together.</p>
